**This is a library of my arduino projects.**

Most of these projects are not work of my own. It is a bunch of projects to help me in my programming career, credit is cited where it is due. I do not claim any of this as my original idea.

BIG help on my programming journey, Paul McWhorter: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfYfK0tzHZTpNFrc_NDKfTA

If you have any comments or questions regarding this library please feel free to ask, thank you!
